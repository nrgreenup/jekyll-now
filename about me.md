I am a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at Indiana University and an aspiring data scientist. As a sociologist, most of my work has been focused on politics and public opinion. However, throughout my tenure at IU, I have devoted the lion's share of my time to developing skills as a quantitative analyst (see section below). I am passionate about using these statistical skills I have developed throughout my graduate training to tell stories with and provide actionable insights using data. This blog highlights that passion. 

### Statistical and Methodological Training and Experience
#### Teaching
I taught 2 semesters of an undergraduate research methods and statistics class, which covered survey design and sampling procedures, measures of central tendency and dispersion, standardization (e.g. z-scores), tabular and graphical displays of data using Microsoft Excel, statistical inference (e.g. confidence intervals and p-values), and a cursory introduction to linear regression. My syllabus can be found [here](https://iu.app.box.com/file/283732193861).
