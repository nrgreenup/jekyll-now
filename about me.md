I am a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at Indiana University and an aspiring data scientist. As a sociologist, most of my work has been focused on politics and public opinion. However, throughout my tenure at IU, I have devoted the lion's share of my time to developing skills as a quantitative analyst (see section below). I am passionate about using these statistical skills I have developed throughout my graduate training to tell stories with and provide actionable insights using data. This blog highlights that passion. 

### Statistical and Methodological Training and Experience
My graduate-level statistical and methodological coursework includes:

| linear regression      | categorical data analysis (logistic/probit, poisson/negative binomial models) | > |
| longitudinal/panel analysis      | time series analysis      | Bayesian statistics      | 
| network analysis       | geographic information systems      | research and survey design      |
