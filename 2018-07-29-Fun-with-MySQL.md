I've been focusing recently on trying to take my SQL skills to the next level -- defining more complicated subqueries, working with triggers and views, Online Analytical Processing tools, and the like. After taking six (exceptionally taught) [online courses](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about) and working through numerous excercises, I wanted to get my hands dirty with some data in a more applied way. In this post, I walk through some queries and analyses I performed on the oft-used [Northwind](https://www.alphasoftware.com/documentation/pages/GettingStarted/GettingStartedTutorials/Basic%20Tutorials/Northwind/northwindMySQL.xml)
data. All of the analyses herein were done in MySQL using the GUI MySQL Workbench.
